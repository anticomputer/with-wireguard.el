* Usage

Put with-wireguard.el in your ~load-path~ and ~(require 'with-wireguard)~

You can start an application inside a network namespace with a given wireguard
configuration using ~M-x with-wg-execute RET~

To remove the namespace after you're done with the application you can use the
~ip netns list~ and ~ip netns delete~ commands, respectively.

Programmatically, you can use the ~with-wg--deflate-ns~ function.
